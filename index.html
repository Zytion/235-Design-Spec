                    The FitnessGramâ„¢ Pacer Test is a multistage aerobic capacity test that progressively gets more
                    difficult as it continues. The 20 meter pacer test will begin in 30 seconds. Line up at the
                    start.

                    According to all known laws of aviation,
                    there is no way a bee should be able to fly.
                    Its wings are too small to get
                    its fat little body off the ground.
                    The bee, of course, flies anyway because bees don't care
                    what humans think is impossible.

                    I'm Rick Harrison, and this is my pawn shop.
                    I work here with my old man and my son, Big Hoss.
                    Everything in here has a story and a price.
                    One thing I've learned after 21 years- you never know
                    what is gonna come through that door.

                    I totally know what you are saying.
                    The other day, I was going to make myself a sandwich.
                    Next thing I know, I have a big old shelf on my plate.
                    Good thing I stopped and looked down before taking a bite.
                    I still have the slivers from last time I that happened.
                    The best thing to do is just play it cool.
                    Act like you actually meant to build a shelf.
                    Consider giving it away as a gift
                    to someone you don't really like.
                </div>
                <div>
                    Another option is to make the shelf into a bench for "vertically challenged people". I would use
                    another word that we all know, but people in this day and age consider that term a slur. But it is
                    very easy to put a ladder next to the shelf and add some pillows and magazines. Then, next time a
                    midget friend comes by for a visit, show him/her how much you care for their comfort.

                    Now, this is a story all about how
                    My life got flipped-turned upside down
                    And I'd like to take a minute
                    Just sit right there
                    I'll tell you how I became the prince of a town called Bel Air

                    In west Philadelphia born and raised
                    On the playground was where I spent most of my days
                    Chillin' out maxin' relaxin' all cool
                    And all shootin some b-ball outside of the school
                    When a couple of guys who were up to no good
                    Started making trouble in my neighborhood
                    I got in one little fight and my mom got scared
                    She said 'You're movin' with your auntie and uncle in Bel Air'
